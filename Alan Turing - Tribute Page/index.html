        <h3 id="headline">Alan Turing's Timeline</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Jun 23, 1912</strong> - Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 
            1912 in Maida Vale, London.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Aug 19, 1926</strong> - At the age of 13, Alan Turing first showed signs 
            of intelligence and potential which was noticed at the Sherborne School.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Aug 29, 1931</strong> - Alan Turing studied from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, in Cambridge. 
            He was first in his class and was an honor student in the field of mathematics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sep 30, 1936</strong> - Alan Turing studied from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, in Cambridge. 
            He was first in his class and was an honor student in the field of mathematics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dec 6, 1939</strong> - Turing helped to solve the essential part of the German naval indicator system 
            and also came up with the idea of sequential analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mar 18, 1940</strong> - Turing was responsible for creating the Bombe which was a cryptanalytic machine 
            used to decrypt the Enigma-enciphered messages being sent from the enemies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Nov 29, 1942</strong> - Turing traveled to the United States to work with the US naval cryptanalysts to 
            create their version of the Bombe and an Enigma in Washington.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Feb 19, 1946</strong> - He presented his paper in February of 1946 where he had presented the first detailed 
            design of a stored program computer setup.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sep 13, 1947</strong> - Turing lived in Hampton, London where worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mar 19, 1948</strong> - Turing created the LU decomposition method that was used and is still used today to solve matrix equations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Aug 31, 1948</strong> - Turing was appointed a position in the mathematics department at the University of Manchester where he worked 
            on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Apr 29, 1950</strong> - Turing was caught in a relationship with an unemployed 19 year old man. He was convicted for indecency because homosexual 
            acts were considered criminal offences in the United Kingdom at the time. This is what lead to his downhill spiral right before his suicide.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Jan 29, 1952</strong> - The turing test was created in 1950. The turing test was created to compare the intelligence of a machine/computer 
            to the intelligence of a human brain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Jan 29, 1952</strong> - Turing's book "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" was published in 1952 which was all about his interest in the biology of organisms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Jun 8, 1954</strong> Turing committed suicide in his house where his housekeeper found him dead.</li>
